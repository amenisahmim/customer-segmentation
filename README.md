# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

## Project Description
This project aims to segment customers of the **Wholesale Customers Dataset** using **K-Means clustering**. 
The goal is to identify groups of customers with similar purchasing behaviors, which can be used for targeted marketing, business strategy, and customer analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset contains annual spending of clients in different product categories. 
**Note:** The dataset is **not included** in this repository due to size/licensing.

## Features
The dataset includes the following features:
- Fresh
- Milk
- Grocery
- Frozen
- Detergents_Paper
- Delicassen
- Channel (categorical)
- Region (categorical)

## Project Steps
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data preprocessing and normalization
4. Choosing the optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method + Silhouette Score)
5. K-Means clustering
6. Visualization (2D PCA, 3D scatter, pairplot, parallel coordinates)
7. Evaluation of clusters
8. Analysis with categorical variables (Channel, Region)
9. Saving the model and scaler
